# A workflow for linking Nanopore reads using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to reconstruct genomic haplotypes.

The figures and content in this repository are derived from the following publication:

**Wennmann, J.T., Lim, F.S., Senger, S., Gani, M., Jehle, J.A., Keilwagen, J (2024). Haplotype determination of the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus by Nanopore sequencing and linkage of single nucleotide variants.** Journal of General Virology. 105 (5), 001983.

## Aim of this repository

-   Learn how to detect SNPs using Illumina data.

-   Transfer the SNP positions to Nanopore data.

-   Link the SNP positions to Nanopore reads.
